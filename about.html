        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            My name is Charan Raj Kandula. I’m from India. I’m currently studying my Master’s in the stream of Computer Science from Stevens Institute of Technology. I have secured 8.3 CGPA in 10th Std, 92.3% Percentage in 12th Std and secured 6.8 CGPA in my undergraduate. </br> </br>


            Everyone knows that computer science is omnipresent and it is presented in every field. </br></br>

Therefore, in my undergraduate I took Computer Science as my major and I have invested my 4 years in developing my software skills. </br></br>

With my technical skills, I have developed few real time projects in my Undergraduate, those are College App, Single Page Resume App, Community App and CGPA Calculator. While talking about my College App project, the app that helps in checking the college information, results, events, news, job updates, calculating CGPA and creating a single page resume. I got this Idea and started working on the app for the new upcoming students and added all useful features into the app.</br></br>
